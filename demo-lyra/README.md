# Lyra Documentation Agent - Demo

**Autonomous Documentation Generation - Demonstration Version**

---

## 🎯 Quick Start (3 Steps)

```bash
# 1. Setup (30 seconds)
./setup_demo.sh

# 2. Run demo (3 seconds)
python src/main.py create-release-notes v2.1

# 3. View output
cat demo/outputs/openshift_v2.1_release_notes.md
```

**That's it!** You just saw Lyra generate release notes from multiple sources.

## 🎬 What is This?

This is a **demonstration version** of Lyra - an autonomous documentation agent that:
- Searches multiple sources (Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Slack, etc.)
- Extracts key decisions from noise (50 comments → 1 decision)
- Synthesizes professional documentation
- Includes citations for transparency

**This demo uses hardcoded data** to show what the full system will do.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### After Demoing to Team:

**If Approved** → Start Sprint 1:
1. Use prompts from `working_with_ai_implementation_guide.md`
2. Implement Sprint 1 (2 days): Jira + GitHub working
3. Demo real release notes generation
4. Continue Sprints 2-6

**If Feedback** → Adjust plan and re-demo
